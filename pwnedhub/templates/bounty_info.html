    <h3>A different kind of bug bounty</h3>
    <p>PwnedHub is a bug bounty experience unlike any other. As a community of hackers, members work together to find and validate bugs in software. Unlike traditional bug bounty sites, PwnedHub doesn't internally review submitted bugs for legitimacy, which often leads to unpaid bounties due to differing perspectives. Rather, PwnedHub relies on the community of members to both submit and review the bugs. Everyone is on the same team working together for the common good!</p>
    <h3>How it works</h3>
    <p>Users submit bugs for any universally accessible application. Once a bug is submitted, the system randomly selects another user as a reviewer. The reviewer must review the bug and decide whether or not to accept or reject the bug as submitted. Bounties are paid in the form of reputation for accepted bugs. The more reputation you have, the more legitimacy and notoriety you gain as an application security professional. The benefits of this are far reaching.</p>
    <p>The bounty provided for each bug is relative to both the category and severity of the bug, as determined by the submitter. Reviewers will take into account assigned severity, so it behooves submitters to not overrate bugs in an effort to gain more reputation. To incentivize reviewers to complete reviews and not hold other users back from gaining reputation, by either not completing or wrongfully rejecting reviews, reviewers receive bonus bounty equal to 25% of the alloted bounty for accepted bugs.</p>
    <p>Submitters and reviewers are permitted to communicate during the review process, and changes may be made until the review process is complete. Both parties are encouraged to use the private PwnMail messaging system for all communications related to undisclosed bugs. Once a bug has been validated and either rejected or accepted, the details of the bug will be disclosed to the public.</p>
